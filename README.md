## Client Stories and Experience Provided
### Client Stories

### Experience Provided
- A meal star carousel on the front page (cycles through meal stars, proetin, bread, pasta, ...).
- Be able to look up recipies by meal(brakefast, lunch, ...) or star type (protein, bread, pasta, ...).
- Have a random, "recipe of the day" (more likely a random recipe).
- Recipies can be favorited by users to allow them to quickly and easily find them.
- Create a form to allow others to commit on recipies to establish a sense of community and fellowship.
- Allow users to submit their own recipies to be rated and used by others.
- Make site fully responsive.
- Have a search bar for to find recipe name (or maybe use it to search ingredience?) .
- Use a rating system for dishes - [[*star amount*, *users rated this count*], [*star amount*, *users rated this count*], ...] - using this frame a 5 star rating system could be build. Take the total number of ratings and average them together for overall rating
